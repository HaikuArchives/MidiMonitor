MidiMonitor 1.0

MidiMonitor displays incoming MIDI messages.
The user can select which physical MIDI input port to monitor.
Source code is provided under the Discordian License (All Rights Reversed).
R4 BeIDE projects for both PPC and Intel are included, as are
binaries ("MidiMonitor" for PPC, "MidiMonitor-x86" for Intel). 

The color used to display a message is based on the
"age" of the message: new messages in bright green,
old messages in black. As messages age the color 
fades to black: often just seeing the flash of
an arriving message (from across the room, for example)
is enough information to make the user happy.

The window is fully resizable (based on William Adams' original
Calendar example).  

The code is not especially efficient, but will handle the
densest MIDI streams without being swamped. The incoming
MIDI stream is sampled at the "Pulse" rate (20 Hz).
Only the most recent message is displayed.

The current (R4) MidiKit doesn't support sharing of MIDI ports,
so you'll get unpredictable results if you run MidiMonitor
on a port that's in use by another app.  If the other app
is your own, you can use the code to instantiate a BMidi-derived
MidiMonitor object and M2BView and Connect() it to whatever you want to watch.
